# SupervisedLearning (K-Nearest Neighbors)

## Introduction

This project is a simple K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm that will take a categorical dataset related to cars, and using "buying price", "price of the maintenance", "number of doors", "capacity in terms of persons to carry", "the size of luggage boot", and "estimated safety of the car" to predict if an specific car is unacceptable, acceptable, good, or very good. The model is trained with different numbers for "k" and saves the most accurate model. This project is fully done in Python3.

## Libraries

- **Pandas**: Used to read CSV data file.
- **Numpy**: Used to create arrays for x and y values for the model.
- **Sklearn**: Used to create the linear regression model and make predictions on final grade.
- **Matplotlib**: Used to create a graph accuracy x K.
- **joblib**: Save the model to a directory in our project folder.
